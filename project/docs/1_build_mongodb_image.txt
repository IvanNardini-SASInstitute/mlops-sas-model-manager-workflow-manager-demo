Description: 

Mongodb image has several issues (Bind mounting bug on windows: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54911021/unable-to-start-docker-mongo-image-on-windows)

For example, what if you would like to seed your mondodb in a way that data scientist can load data
from it and start building its models?

To populate mongodb you have to run mongo import command when the container starts via script. But you are
launching mongod in background and then running script. But you should be running your script in background 
and then start mongod as main process.

This cause failure on mongodb container. 

That's why I used the 2-containers approach. 

Inspired by microservices phylosopy, I seed db using another docker container whose only purpose 
is to populate mongodb, then exit. 

Steps: 

1) Create a dockerfile for Mongodb seeder service
    a) COPY data you want to seed in Mongodb
    b) CMD mongoimport -v --host mongo --db training_database --collection churn_data --type csv --file /data/db/sample.csv --headerline

    ! Notice: host have to be equal to the name of mongodb service in docker-compose.yml

2) Add mongo services to docker-compose file
    a) mongodb: database service
    b) mongo_seeder: seeder service
    c) mongo_express: GUI on mongodb
